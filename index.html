                                <p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thorton during an
                                    internal competition at Twitter in August 2011. It is an open-source framework that
                                    is used to design responsive websites better, faster, and easier. It is a
                                    beginner-friendly and the most popular open-source framework that includes HTML,
                                    CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap can be used to create web applications with any
                                    server-side Technology like Java, PHP, etc., and its responsive design allows
                                    platforms like Mobile phones, tablets, and computers. Bootstrap contains CSS and
                                    JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, icons,
                                    and other interface components. It is based on object-oriented CSS. Bootstrap helps
                                    to design and develop website templates quickly.</p>

                                <p><strong>Tailwind</strong> CSS was initially developed by Adam Wathan, and the first
                                    version was released back on the 1st of November, 2017. Tailwind CSS is a
                                    utility-first CSS framework for building custom user interfaces rapidly and
                                    efficiently. It is an inline styling used to achieve a sleek interface without
                                    writing code for your own CSS. Tailwind CSS offers customizability and flexibility
                                    to transform the appearance and feel of the elements. Tailwind CSS is not the first
                                    utility-first CSS library, but it is one of the most popular and light ones. It is a
                                    highly customizable, low-level CSS framework, and it provides all the building
